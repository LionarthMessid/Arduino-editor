# Arduino Editor Modularization Plan

## Current Structure Analysis

The current project is an Arduino code editor with a React frontend and FastAPI backend. The application allows users to write, compile, and upload Arduino code, manage libraries and boards, and monitor serial output.

### Current Issues

- Backend code is monolithic with all functionality in a single `server.py` file
- Frontend has all components in a single `App.js` file
- No separation of concerns or modularity
- Limited code reusability
- Difficult to maintain and extend

## Modularization Plan

### Backend Modularization

1. **Create a modular structure with the following components:**
   - `api/` - API routes and controllers
   - `services/` - Business logic
   - `models/` - Data models
   - `utils/` - Utility functions
   - `config/` - Configuration
   - `middleware/` - Middleware functions

2. **Specific modules to create:**
   - `api/boards.py` - Board-related endpoints
   - `api/libraries.py` - Library management endpoints
   - `api/compile.py` - Code compilation endpoints
   - `api/files.py` - File management endpoints
   - `api/serial.py` - Serial communication endpoints
   - `services/arduino_cli.py` - Arduino CLI wrapper
   - `models/schemas.py` - Pydantic models
   - `utils/file_utils.py` - File handling utilities
   - `config/settings.py` - Application settings
   - `middleware/cors.py` - CORS middleware

### Frontend Modularization

1. **Create a component-based structure:**
   - `components/` - Reusable UI components
   - `pages/` - Page components
   - `services/` - API services
   - `hooks/` - Custom React hooks
   - `context/` - React context providers
   - `utils/` - Utility functions
   - `styles/` - CSS and styling

2. **Specific components to create:**
   - `components/Editor/` - Code editor component
   - `components/SerialMonitor/` - Serial monitor component
   - `components/SerialPlotter/` - Serial plotter component
   - `components/FileExplorer/` - File explorer component
   - `components/BoardManager/` - Board manager component
   - `components/LibraryManager/` - Library manager component
   - `components/Toolbar/` - Toolbar component
   - `services/api.js` - API service
   - `hooks/useArduino.js` - Arduino-related hooks
   - `context/ArduinoContext.js` - Arduino context provider

## Implementation Steps

### Backend Implementation

1. Create the directory structure
2. Move code from `server.py` to appropriate modules
3. Create a new main application file
4. Update imports and references
5. Test the modularized backend

### Frontend Implementation

1. Create the directory structure
2. Extract components from `App.js`
3. Create service modules for API calls
4. Implement context providers
5. Update imports and references
6. Test the modularized frontend

## Benefits of Modularization

- Improved code organization and readability
- Better separation of concerns
- Enhanced maintainability
- Easier testing
- Simplified extension and feature addition
- Better collaboration potential
- Reduced cognitive load when working on specific features
